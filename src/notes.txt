First of all: this project took me so long with quite a few errors:

1. getting Objects are not valid as a React Child error.
=> Not loading initial time so i had to set an if statement only if questions weren't null/undefined it 
would run and create a quiz element.

2.

3.

4.

//////////
Annoying Problems:

Scrimba refreshed and my data was not saved properly, 
and I basically had to restart my project

I had to then setup vite and react using node and i've never done that before, so took a while

Thinking how to use state and useEffect to map out the entire website was very interesting, I had to 
rethink and move a lot of components/functions around.

I would Refactor the code, and cause some new errors, which took some time to fix.


Things I considered while doing this project: 

//style logic : 
// If quiz is not finished : background: normal
// if quiz is not finished and selected: background lightblue
// if quiz is finished and not selected and not correct: use default  
// if quiz is finished and selected and wrong: background: opacity green
// if quiz is finished and selected and correct: background: light green

if question.answers = answersArray
setQuestions = [...prevQuestions, question.answer[index].selected = true
question.answer.index[selected] = true ]

shuffle array algorithm - Fisher Yates Shuffle Algorithm[improvised]
    1.Start index at max index. then roll a random number between 0 and max index
    2.Remove the object/variable at the index, and push it to a new array.

The page was showing &quot; instead of ["], and others for [',`] etc.  
Used htmlentites decode to fix that. thanks @Misty from Scrimba discord for helping with that.
